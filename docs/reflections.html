                    <li>There were a lot of similarities and differences with Wordpress and GitHub
                    pages. In GitHub pages, some of the most significant challenges for a new learner is 
                    figuring out how to push all of your code to your GitHub repo. Even though this 
                    is a challenge, I find this an advantage over Wordpress because it gives you 
                    more control and knowledge over what you're doing. 
                        Modifying the layout and organization on GitHub pages was much more difficult
                    because you physically had to code everything you wanted to change, unlike Wordpress.
                    Some skills necessary for GitHub pages is your basic knowledge of your computer
                    and knowing where your files are located, because that is very important. One thing that
                    I would personally like to improve on after finishing the project is my 
                    CSS knowledge and to learn more about it.
                        Using Wordpress was much faster and more efficient, but less personalization.
                    There weren't a lot of challenges to using the site, just knowing your way around psu sites
                    is helpful. Some advantages to using it is that it's user friendly for beginners.
                    Overall, the entire assignment was extremely educational. Having to start from scratch on
                    a website really teachers you the importance of it.</li>
